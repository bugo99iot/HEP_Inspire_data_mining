# hep_inspire_data_mining
We analyse the [HEP-Inspire] database to determine which countries are more likely to produce academic figures in the field of high energy physics.

# Files
UG_results.json and PHD_results.json contain a UG/PHD count per country. The "plots" folder contains all plots and maps obtained from the analysis.

# Data
We analyse the dataset "HepNames" and "Institutions" which can be accessed via [Inspire].

# Project
I have discussed about this project on [Medium].
